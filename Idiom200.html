    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Blue Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 기존의 검색 및 탐색 구조를 유지하면서 '청각적 학습' 요소를 통합했습니다. 각 카드에 '스피커 아이콘 버튼'을 배치하여 직관적으로 소리를 들을 수 있게 했습니다. Web Speech API를 활용하여 외부 의존성 없이 텍스트 음성 변환(TTS)을 구현했습니다. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Interaction (TTS): 'speak-btn' 클래스를 가진 버튼을 클릭하면 브라우저의 SpeechSynthesis를 호출합니다.
        - Data Handling: 예시 대화에 포함된 HTML 태그(<br> 등)는 음성 변환 시 정규식을 통해 제거하여 깨끗한 문장으로 읽도록 처리했습니다.
        - Event Handling: 스피커 버튼 클릭 시 카드가 접히거나 펴지는 것을 방지하기 위해 event.stopPropagation()을 사용했습니다.
